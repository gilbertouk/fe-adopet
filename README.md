AdoPet is a fictitious company that acts as an intermediary between pet adopters and NGOs/Shelters. AdoPet's proposal is to attract more users and increase interaction between potential adopters and representatives of these NGOs/Shelters, and to this end the project aims to implement a platform and bring the company into the digital world.

This project was developed as a result of a Front-End Challenge (4th edition) exclusively for students of the [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br) Technology School.

### Adjustments and improvements

The project is still in development and the next updates will focus on the following tasks:

- Error handling of requests made to the backend API
- Error handling for pages not found
- Implement Loading Spinner or Skeleton Screens on pages that make API requests
- Fix some problems with the page layout
